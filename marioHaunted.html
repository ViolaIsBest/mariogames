        <h1> Nintendo's SPOOKY Mario: Prepare for HORROR! </h1>

        <p id = "p1"> Nintendo has a long history of adding some spook to Mario, starting back all the way to the Boos and 
            ghost houses in Super Mario World. Super Mario Bros 3 was the first game to introduce the Boo, a ghost
            enemy that moved towards you when you were facing away and covered it's eyes when you were looking at it.
            Since then, boos have evolved, taking on many forms from the "stretcher" in Mario Maker to the "Peepa" ghost 
            in Super Mario 3D world.

        <h2> A GHOSTLY Surprise </h2>
        <p id = "p2"> Ghost Houses first made an appearance in Super Mario World, and have haunted the franchise ever since. These levels are confusing,
            mazes often set with loops, hidden doors, and invisible walls. The boos are watching your every step, clustering ominously over the 
            ceiling ... watch out, cause any move you make might be your last.
        </p>

        <h2> Luigi's Mansion </h2>
        <p> Perhaps the most iconic of Nintendo is Luigi's Mansion, a stand-alone series where the scaredy-cat Luigi has to traverse haunted manors and mansions,
            fending off ghosts with only the power of his vacuum, the Poltergust 3000. With the help of the eccentric Professor E. Gadd, Luigi has to muster all his
            courage to ward off the ghosts to escape.
